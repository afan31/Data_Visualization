# Data_Visualization

In this project, I have analyzed technology stock data (Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon) form the stock market, using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to get stock information and visualize different aspects of it. This project helps one answer
some of the key questions of stock market analysis, such as :

• What was the change in price of the stock over time ?

• What was the daily return of the stock on an average ?

• What was the moving average of the various stocks ?

• What was the correlation between different stocks'​ at closing prices ?

• What was the correlation between different stocks' at return prices ?

I also did risk analysis on the stock and predicted future stock prices through Monte Carlo method, thus helping us to figure out :

• How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock ?

• How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior ?
